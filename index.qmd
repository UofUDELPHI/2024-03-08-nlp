## General Information

**What**: This workshop will introduce methods for using natural language processing (NLP) to extract information from unstructured text data. There will be a primary focus on applications to clinical text and electronic health record notes, but the methods we learn could be applied to other domains.

**Who**: The course is aimed at graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and other researchers across campus who are interested in learning how to use NLP for data analysis.

**Requirements**: Participants must bring a laptop on which they can access the internet via a web browser. We will be using [Google Colab notebooks](https://colab.google/) throughout this workshop. This workshop will use Python, and students are expected to have an introductory level of Python. If you do not have Python knowledge, we strongly recommend registering for our [Introduction to Data Analysis in Python workshop](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScILeDCW5LTwMH2FXYEm7Ix9715aFMc8HTaeKl9fC0F7UPMvg/viewform?pli=1) or completing our virtual short course on Python (in development).
